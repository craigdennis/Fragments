  description: The interior of the wagon is dim and cramped, its wooden walls stained
    with damp and streaked with grime. Chains hang loosely from the floor, connecting
    to the ankles of the half-dozen prisoners around you. The air is heavy with the
    sour scent of unwashed bodies and the metallic tang of rusted iron.

      nextButtonText: Your gaze drifts to the others in the wagon
    - paragraphText: "To your left, a woman with wild, unkempt hair is muttering
        to herself. Her eyes dart from one corner of the wagon to another, her lips
        moving in a hurried whisper you can\u2019t make out. "
      nextButtonText: '*You notice another prisoner sitting across from you'
    - paragraphText: 'Across from you, an older man sits quietly, his back pressed
        against the wagon wall. His gray beard is neatly trimmed despite his ragged
        appearance, and his sunken eyes gleam with a sharp intelligence. '
      nextButtonText: '*At the far end, you spot someone else who catches your attention'
    - paragraphText: Finally, at the far end of the wagon, a large, muscular figure
        leans heavily against the bars. His wrists are shackled like the rest, but
        his movements are slow and deliberate, each shift of his body making the
        chains clink ominously. A jagged scar runs from his temple to his jawline,
        and a faint, cynical smirk curls his lips as he watches the others with cold
        detachment.
