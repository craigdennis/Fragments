  description: "Darkness and cold greet your senses as you stir. The rattle of iron
    wheels on uneven ground jolts you awake. Your body aches as if you\u2019ve been
    traveling for days, though the memory of the journey eludes you. Groggily, you
    open your eyes to a dim, grayish light filtering through the slats of a prison
    wagon. The scent of damp wood and rusted iron fills your nose.\n\nChains bite
    into your wrists and ankles, shackling you to the floor of the wagon. Around
    you, other prisoners lie in a similar state\u2014some unconscious, others staring
    listlessly at the moving horizon. Beyond the bars of the wagon, dense, foreboding
    woods stretch into the misty distance, their skeletal branches clawing at the
    gray sky.\n\nYou struggle to recall how you ended up here, but your mind is a
    fractured mirror. Bits and pieces of memories\u2014an inn's rowdy laughter, the
    sharp tang of steel, and an ominous voice whispering in the dark\u2014flash briefly
    before fading into oblivion.\n\nA gruff voice shouts from the driver\u2019s perch.
    \"Keep 'em quiet! No one cares what they did!\" A second voice, crueler and mocking,
    replies, \"Bet they won\u2019t last long in the mines anyhow.\"\n\nAs the wagon
    lurches, you notice something in the corner of your vision\u2014a faint glow
    coming from beneath your shirt. An object presses lightly against your chest,
    concealed under the ragged tunic they left you with. It hums softly, almost imperceptibly,
    against your skin."
