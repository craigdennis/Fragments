  description: "You try to piece together how you ended up here, but your mind is
    a blank slate. You can\u2019t even recall your own name, let alone what you might
    have done to deserve this fate. Fragments of sound, light, and motion flicker
    in your memory\u2014like echoes of a dream\u2014but they refuse to take shape.
    Your pulse quickens as panic threatens to rise, but you shove it down. Questions
    will come later, you tell yourself"
