  description: "Darkness and cold greet your senses as you stir. The rattle of iron
    wheels on uneven ground jolts you awake. Your body aches as if you\u2019ve been
    traveling for days, though the memory of the journey eludes you. Groggily, you
    open your eyes to a dim, grayish light filtering through the slats of a prison
    wagon. The scent of damp wood and rusted iron fills your nose."
