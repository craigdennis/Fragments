  description: The wild woman’s head tilts to the side, her tangled hair falling
    over one shoulder. A crooked smile creeps onto her face, but there’s no warmth
    in it. “Time,” she says, her voice low and sharp, “is a funny thing, isn’t it?
    Here in this wagon, it stretches and folds, like a snake coiling on itself. How
    long have I been here? Long enough to forget where the chains began and the road
    ends.”

      nextButtonText: Her eyes shift toward the barred window.
    - paragraphText: She pauses, her eyes narrowing as they dart toward the barred
        window of the wagon. “Maybe it’s been days, maybe years. Does it even matter?
        The wheels keep turning, the forest keeps watching, and the shadows… they’re
        always waiting. That’s the only truth here.”
      nextButtonText: Her gaze snaps back to you.
    - paragraphText: “But if you’re asking how long I’ve been a prisoner—well, that
        depends. You mean just the wagon, or all the years before it when I was free,
        but not really? Because the chains started long before these iron ones.”
