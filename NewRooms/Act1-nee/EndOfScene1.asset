    - paragraphText: The wild woman’s words linger in your mind, curling around your
        thoughts like smoke. They’ve left you unsettled—more so than you’d like to
        admit. As the wagon rattles onward, you find yourself glancing toward the
        barred slats, drawn to the forest beyond.
      nextButtonText: Your eyes settle on the darkened woods outside.
    - paragraphText: The trees press close on either side of the trail, their trunks
        thick and gnarled, twisted by time and weather. Moss clings to the bark in
        dark, creeping patches, and the forest floor is choked with undergrowth and
        scattered leaves. Sunlight struggles to pierce the dense canopy, casting
        the woods in an oppressive gloom.
      nextButtonText: Something catches your eye among the trees.
    - paragraphText: You think you see movement between the trees—a brief flicker,
        like a shadow slipping behind a trunk. You lean slightly, peering closer,
        but it’s gone before you can focus on it. A trick of the light, perhaps,
        or your mind playing games after the woman’s cryptic ramblings.
      nextButtonText: The wagon’s sudden jolt draws your attention back.
    - paragraphText: The frail man wheezes sharply, the sound breaking the uneasy
        quiet. Across from you, the scarred man’s smirk lingers as he hums softly
        to himself, his eyes half-lidded but strangely alert.
      nextButtonText: The oppressive darkness outside seems to deepen.
    - paragraphText: A crow caws from somewhere unseen, the sound cutting through
        the grinding of the wagon wheels. You glance toward the guards perched atop
        the wagon. One of them shifts, his hand brushing the hilt of his blade as
        he surveys the treeline.
