    - paragraphText: Her expression sharpens, her head tilting as she studies you
        with an unsettling intensity. For a moment, she’s silent, her lips twitching
        as if chewing over your words.
      nextButtonText: Her whisper cuts through the silence.
    - paragraphText: “Deaf to your memories, hmm?” she whispers, her voice thick
        with intrigue. “That’s worse than not hearing the whispers. Memories are
        the thread that ties you to who you were… without them, you’re a puppet with
        cut strings, dangling in the void.”
      nextButtonText: She leans in, her tone turning conspiratorial.
    - paragraphText: “But maybe that’s a gift,” she continues, her tone almost conspiratorial.
        “Memories are traps, you know. They anchor you, weigh you down. Maybe you
        were meant to start fresh. Clean. Free.”
      nextButtonText: Her gaze shifts toward the ceiling, her voice lowering.
    - paragraphText: “They must’ve taken them. The shadows don’t like loose ends.
        If they left you empty, there’s a reason.” Her gaze snaps back to yours,
        and a grin, sharp and almost triumphant, splits her face.
      nextButtonText: Her grin widens as she poses her question.
    - paragraphText: “Do you want them back, stranger? Or will you make something
        new from the silence?”
