    - paragraphText: The wild woman’s smile fades, and for the first time, her expression
        turns serious, almost somber. She leans back, her eyes narrowing as though
        weighing your words against something unseen.
      nextButtonText: Her voice takes on a low, warning tone.
    - paragraphText: “Careful with that kind of talk. The past doesn’t stay dead
        just because you want it to. It waits, like a shadow, just out of reach.
        And when it returns, it doesn’t ask for your permission.”
      nextButtonText: She pulls her knees to her chest, her tone softening.
    - paragraphText: “Some memories, yes, they’ll be good,” she continues, her tone
        softening. “They’ll remind you who you were, give you strength when you think
        you’ve got none left. They’ll make you fight.”
      nextButtonText: Her gaze sharpens suddenly.
    - paragraphText: “But others… others will rot you from the inside. They’ll twist
        your heart, fill your mind with bile. They’ll whisper lies and truths so
        close together you won’t know the difference. And once you remember them,
        they’ll never let you go.”
      nextButtonText: Her words drop to a near-whisper, heavy with foreboding.
    - paragraphText: “You don’t get to choose which memories come back. They’ll come
        when they’re ready. And when they do, you’d better hope you’re strong enough
        to bear them.”
      nextButtonText: She settles back into the shadows.
    - paragraphText: “Leave the past buried if you want. But don’t be surprised if
        it digs its way out.”
