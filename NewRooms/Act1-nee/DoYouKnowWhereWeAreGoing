  description: The wild woman’s lips curl into a smirk, though her eyes hold no humor.
    “Oh, I know,” she says, her voice lilting like a mocking song. “We’re going to
    a place where names are forgotten, where the sun barely touches, and screams
    are swallowed by the earth.”

    - paragraphText: The wild woman’s lips curl into a smirk, though her eyes hold
        no humor. “Oh, I know,” she says, her voice lilting like a mocking song.
        “We’re going to a place where names are forgotten, where the sun barely touches,
        and screams are swallowed by the earth.”
      nextButtonText: Her voice lowers as she leans in closer.
    - paragraphText: “The mines, or maybe worse. The guards won’t say, but you can
        feel it, can’t you? The weight of it, pulling us closer with every jolt of
        the wagon. It’s the kind of place that eats people, grinds them into nothing.
        Some go in and come out different. Most just don’t come out at all.”
      nextButtonText: Her tone shifts, darker and more ominous.
    - paragraphText: “But it’s not just the mines. No, there’s something else out
        there, waiting. A hunger, old and patient. It doesn’t care about the chains
        or the guards. It just takes.”
      nextButtonText: She pulls back, her smirk sharper now.
    - paragraphText: “So, do I know where we’re going? Sure. But the real question
        is—what’s waiting for us when we get there?”
