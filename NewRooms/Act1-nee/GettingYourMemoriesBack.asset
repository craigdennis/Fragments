  description: Her smile fades, replaced by a somber look that feels too lucid, too

    - paragraphText: Her smile fades, replaced by a somber look that feels too lucid,
        too knowing, for someone in her state. She leans back slightly, her eyes
        narrowing as if weighing your words against some unseen truth.
      nextButtonText: Her voice drops to a low murmur.
    - paragraphText: “Want them back, do you? Careful what you wish for. Memories
        aren’t just stories—they’re shards of who you are. Some will glimmer, light
        your way, and make you stronger than you know. But others…"
      nextButtonText: She pauses, tracing jagged patterns in the air.
    - paragraphText: “Others will cut you. Dark fragments, sharp and cruel, will cling
        to you, twisting everything you think you know. Strength and poison—both
        flow from the same well.”
      nextButtonText: Her voice softens to a near whisper.
    - paragraphText: “They don’t tell you how heavy they are, those pieces of the
        past. You might find one… clutch it close… and wish you’d left it buried.”
      nextButtonText: Her gaze burns with sudden intensity.
    - paragraphText: “But you’re already walking the path, aren’t you? You’ll seek
        the fragments, even the ones that stain your soul. Just remember this: memories
        can’t be unmade. Once you take them back, they’re yours forever. The good…
        and the bad.”
